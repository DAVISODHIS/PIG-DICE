                <p class="lead">Pig Dice is a cool game that you can play with your friends,that allows you and your

                <h4 class="d-inline-block" id="gameplay">How to Play</h4>
                <div class="gameplay">
                    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to
                        "hold"</p>
                    <p>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</p>
                    <p>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn
                        continues.</p>
                    <p>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next
                        player's turn.</p>
                    <p class="lead">The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
